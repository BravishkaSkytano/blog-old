> Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington (1882-1944), English astronomer and physicist, described the approach of mordern scientists by using the analogy of a fisherman who casts repeatedly into the lake with a net that has two-inch mesh. He brings the catch to shore and sorts it out―records, classifies, and describes it. He then seeks a series of conclusions regarding the organisms to be found in the lake. One conclusion that he dare not make is that there are no organisms in the lake smaller than two inches; they may well have escaped the net he was using. So the scientist use a "two-inch mesh net," by which certain facts are caught, but other facts equally real may not be revealed by the same methods. For this reason, and others, the true scientist comprehends the limitations and fallibility of scientific inquiry.

When I read this in my biology book, I laughed. How relevant this is dozens of years later!
